# 🎨 Figma Design - Special Lab Enrollment and Tasks Management System

Hi there! 👋  
I'm currently learning **Figma** and this is my **first ever design project**. I'm still a **newbie**, so this design is basic and experimental — but it's part of my learning journey and I'm really excited to share it here!

## 📘 About the Project

This design is for a MERN stack project called **Special Lab Enrollment and Tasks Management System**, which allows:

- Students to register for special labs (like AI, Data Science, etc.)
- Faculty to manage students, interviews, and tasks
- Admins to manage everything from one dashboard

## 🖼️ Design File

I've uploaded my Figma design in **PDF format** for now, since I'm still exploring the tool.  
You can find it here in the `/designs` folder (or wherever you place the PDF).

## 💡 Note

I'm still learning and improving — feedback is welcome! This is just a starting point, and more polished designs will come in the future as I get better with Figma. 🙌

Thanks for checking it out! 😄
